# image-recognition-api-project
This is a part of my Image Recognition Project.
As a BackEnd , I have used Node.js and Express.js(a framework of node.js) .

As this project is based on face detection API from Clarifai (https://www.clarifai.com/),
you must add your own API key in the controllers/image.js file to connect to Clarifai API.

For connecting server to the Database I have used postgreSQL .
So make sure for the Password u will use in server.js
